## Installation

1. Install Silk Mod Loader: https://github.com/SilkModding/Silk
2. Download the mod dll file from [here](https://github.com/Dylan-Grinboju/spiderheck_stats_mod/releases) or from the sidebar in the Github page, or build the project yourself from this repo
3. Place the mod file in your Silk mods folder
4. Launch the game

## Notes and Disclaimers
- Stats reset when starting a new game. After the game ending you can return to the lobby and the overlay will show the last game's stats
- There are Bugs. Not just the ones that you need to kill in the game, also in this mod
- There are some kills that won't register such as activating a weapon with another (hitting a grenade with a particle blade). This just complicates the logic and is up to interpretation of who gets the kill in difficult scenarios. Also, this is just very complicated to track, and I wasn't feeling like coding it
- This probably won't work with multiplayer, you are welcome to try and send me feedback, but I don't plan to support it anytime soon

## The Future
- I plan to continue expanding this mod
- Some of the immediate ideas are saving the stats to a local log file, and expanding on the stats themselves, like types of enemies killed, how many shields destroyed, and fun stuff like greatest height reached by a player in game
- I welcome any help or feedback! You can send me a message on Discord or Reddit, open a PR or try to send me a bug report using smoke signals. Some options are better than others
